# Cricket-Matches-Sheet-Analysis
This project focuses on extracting, transforming, and analyzing cricket match data from Cricsheet.org. The goal is to automate data collection, store it in an SQL database, perform deep analysis using SQL and Python, and visualize key insights through both Python plots and Power BI dashboards.

### Important Note
Due to GitHub's 100MB file size limit, this repository only includes the core Jupyter Notebook (`main.ipynb`) and documentation.

The full project folder (~1.5GB) contains:
- Extracted JSON data (`extracted_matches/`) ~1.3GB
- SQLite database (`cricsheet_analysis.db`) ~340MB

These files could not be pushed to GitHub directly.

If you want to run this project:
1. Clone the repo
2. Run the notebook cells step-by-step
3. The notebook will recreate all required files (download JSONs, parse data, create DB)

Feel free to reach out if you face issues.

### Project Objectives
1. Web scrape cricket data using Selenium
2. Parse and transform JSON files into structured data
3. Store match and ball-level data in SQLite
4. Perform SQL-based data analysis
5. Visualize trends using Python (matplotlib, seaborn)
6. Build an interactive Power BI dashboard

### Tools and Tech stacks:
1. Python (Selenium, Pandas, JSON)
2. SQLite (via sqlite3 connector)
3. SQL (20 queries)
4. Power BI Desktop
5. Matplotlib, Seaborn

### Web Scraping with Selenium
Aim: Navigate to cricsheet.org and download match data ZIPs for Test, ODI, T20, and IPL formats.

```
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By 
import requests
import os
import time

# Navigating the driver to the website. 

driver = webdriver.Chrome()  
driver.get("https://cricsheet.org/matches/")

time.sleep(8) # Time for the website to fully load all the contents

zip_links = driver.find_elements(By.XPATH, '//a[contains(@href, ".zip")]') # finds all the elements that are .zip files
download_urls = [link.get_attribute('href') for link in zip_links] # stores the links contained in the elements
print(f"Total JSON links found: {len(download_urls)}")

data = 'cricsheet_json_files'
os.makedirs(data, exist_ok=True) # creating a folder for the JSON zip files to be downloaded

required_matches = ['tests_json.zip', 'odis_json.zip', 't20s_json.zip', 'ipl_json.zip'] # The zip files we need to download
filtered_urls = []
for url in download_urls:
    file_name = url.split("/")[-1] # gives name of the zip file
    if file_name in required_matches:
        filtered_urls.append(url)

len_of_filtered_urls = len(filtered_urls)
print(f"Downloaded {len_of_filtered_urls} files into '{data}' folder.")
driver.quit()
```

OUTPUT:
```Downloaded 4 files into 'cricsheet_json_files' folder.```

```
# this is for automating the downloading & storing part:

for url in filtered_urls:
    file_name = url.split("/")[-1]  
    full_path = os.path.join(data, file_name)
    
    # Only download if the .zip file doesn't exist already
    if not os.path.exists(full_path):
        response = requests.get(url)
        with open(full_path, "wb") as file:
            file.write(response.content)
        print(f"Downloaded: {file_name}")
    else:
        print(f"Already exists: {file_name}")
```

OUTPUT:
```
Already exists: tests_json.zip
Already exists: odis_json.zip
Already exists: t20s_json.zip
Already exists: ipl_json.zip
```

### Data Extraction and JSON Parsing
In this step, our aim is to extract downloaded .zip files and parse JSON files into structured DataFrames

```
import zipfile

extract_folder = 'extracted_matches'
os.makedirs(extract_folder,exist_ok = True)

for file in os.listdir("cricsheet_json_files"):
    if file.endswith(".zip"):
        zip_path = os.path.join("cricsheet_json_files", file)
        match_type = file.replace("_json.zip", "")
        output_path = os.path.join(extract_folder,match_type)
        os.makedirs(output_path, exist_ok=True)

        with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_path, 'r') as zip_ref:
            zip_ref.extractall(output_path)
        print(f"Extracted: {file} to {output_path}")

1. We've created four ball-by-ball structured datasets for different match types(test,odi,ipl,t20).

2. We've also created match-level summaries dataset as well.

All these different dataframes for querying some useful insights from the JSON data.

### SQLite Database Creation & EDA Using Python:

```
import sqlite3

# connecting to the SQLite database using connector

conn = sqlite3.connect("cricsheet_analysis.db")
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Save each dataframe to a table in SQLite
df_test.to_sql("test_matches", conn, if_exists="replace", index=False)
df_odi.to_sql("odi_matches", conn, if_exists="replace", index=False)
df_t20.to_sql("t20_matches", conn, if_exists="replace", index=False)
df_ipl.to_sql("ipl_matches", conn, if_exists="replace", index=False)

print("All data inserted successfully into SQLite")
```

OUTPUT:
```
All data inserted successfully into SQLite
```

### SQL Queries for Insights:

query1: The top 10 batsmen by total runs in ODI matches:
```
query = """
SELECT batter, SUM(runs_batter) AS total_runs
FROM odi_matches
GROUP BY batter
ORDER BY total_runs DESC
LIMIT 10;
"""

df_result = pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)

### Power BI Dashboard:

Finally, we're creating an interactive visual dashboard using Power BI.

1. Connected SQLite DB via ODBC

2. Used stacked column charts, bar graphs, pie charts
